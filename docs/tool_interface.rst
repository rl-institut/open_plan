**************************
Tool interface description
**************************

The tool should enable its users to simulate a local energy system model with sector-coupling (like an industry park or a neighbourhood) and operate optimizations with constrains on it for planning purposes (not thought for operation).

The optimization is taken care of in the backend with the `oemof <https://oemof.org/>`_ framework. The role of the interface is thus to gather the necessary input parameters and to provide a vizualization of the outputs.

It is wished that this interface helps several actors with different perspectives and backgrounds to run scenarios or re-run scenarios changing only a few input parameters, compare their results with other scenarios and possibly engage in a dialogue.

One way to fullfill this wish, is to design the tool's interface collaboratively: by inviting different actors in a dialogue about the interface's functionalities before implementing the interface itself.

We start by defining a few :ref:`concepts<concepts-menu>` which come handy when describing the interface and what the users will be able to interact with and see.
One of these concepts is the :ref:`view-component-def`, it is analoguous to a building block we can use to describe (and then implement) the user interface functionalities in a modular way.

It is possible to deploy an interactive presentation of the :ref:`views<view-def>` made with the help of the :ref:`view-component-def` by following `these step <https://github.com/rl-institut/open_plan/blob/dev/website/README.md>`_

We are welcoming feedbacks

.. _concepts-menu:

Concepts definition
===================

In order to describe the interface, a few definitions are required at first.

.. _view-def:

view
----
    Description of a given state of the user interface: what should the user be able to interact with in that *view*, which other *view* can the user visit from the current *view*. The collection of *views* form together the user interface. Note: the view does not describe how the interface looks like to the user, this is described in the *view-rendering*.

.. _view-component-def:

view-component
--------------
    A *view-component* is a part of a *view* which can be described independently from the view and could be reused in different *views* (a menu bar for example). A *view-component* is described in terms of its attributes and its actions. For example a menu bar has a nested list of items (each item can itself be a list of item: submenus). Each item, if not itself a list, consists of a label (what the user will see) and an action (what will be done upon clicking/selecting the item).

.. _attribute-def:

attribute
---------
    An attribute contains the essential information needed to characterize and render a :ref:`view-def` or a :ref:`view-component-def`. An attribute might be visible in the :ref:`view-def` or :ref:`view-component-def` but it can also just be information. An attribute can be linked to a certain number of :ref:`action-def` and to certain :ref:`requirement-def`.

.. _action-def:

action
------
    An action describes what the user can do in a certain :ref:`view-def` or :ref:`view-component-def`. Each action has an index which is used to link it to an :ref:`attribute-def`.
Example: [index] The user can click on button B to trigger action C

.. _requirement-def:

requirement
------------
A requirement describes specific conditions of a :ref:`view-def`, a :ref:`view-component-def`, an :ref:`action-def` or an :ref:`attribute-def` that should be met. Each requirement has an index which is used to link it to an :ref:`attribute-def`.
 Example: [index] The button B cannot be clicked unless text input C is not filled by user.

.. _view-rendering-def:

view-rendering
--------------
    Description of how a *view* or *component-view* will be rendered on the screen. This belongs to frontend and is where the details about color, size, font, placement on screen matter. For example a menu bar which is a *view-component* can have many different *view-rendering* (horizontal with buttons, expandable vertically only on hover, etc.).

.. _energy-type-def:

energy type
-----------
    An energy type is represented by a bus. It describes the energy carrier for an energy sector: heat, electricity, gas, biomass, H2O.

.. _main-window-def:

main window
-----------
    It is the window from which the user can interact with the open_plan tool on their computer.


.. _widget-def:

widget
------
    Smaller window within the tool's :ref:`main-window-def`.
    A *widget* can be moved around by the user within the :ref:`main-window-def` and collapsed into another *widget* (then each *widget* is accessible via tabs).
