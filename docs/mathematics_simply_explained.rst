--------

Aim of the open_plan tool:
- Presentation of possible future scenarios for the expansion of renewable energies
energies (heat/ electricity/ e-mob)
- Determination of optimal combinations and dimensioning of technologies
- Presentation of the benefits of individual technologies
 
Solving energy management problems with the help of linear optimization

General information on modeling

Reduction of the considered system to subcomponents with a certain level of detail

real system
Simplifications are necessary
Results can be complex

Energy systems based on renewable energies can become very complex.

The components with which an energy supply system can be modeled in open_plan are classified as follows:

- Sources
- Sinks
- Transformer
- Storage
