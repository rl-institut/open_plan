4,CO2 upper limit,An upper bound on the CO2 emissions,T of CO2,,Environmental,,,component/constraint exists,,
5,Energy source,Energy sources with their capacity open for optimization and technology,,,Technical,,,?,,A user can select 
6,Storage units,Energy storage units with their capacity and technology,,,Technical,,,?,,If the user know already that they are going to use a commercial model
7,Existing energy source infrastructure,Existing energy infrastructure not up for optimization (with given capacities),kW,,Technical,,,component/constraint exists,,
8,Existing energy storage infrastructure,Existing storage infrastructure not up for optimization (with given capacities),kW,,Technical,,,,,
9,GPS coordinates,"GPS coordinate of the location, to retrieve the weather conditions in case of missing timeseries. Could be a point, a set of points, or a polygon",,,GIS,,,function exists,,
10,Grid parameters (v2.0 of the tool),"Grid parameters such as:  power, voltage, frequence, line length, line impedance, transformers, topology",,,Technical,,,"I'm not sure about this. There are components which represent also the electrical characteristics of the grid (not only energy characteristics) and people are further developing it right now. Not sure, what is already there and what is missing, but I think it's not that difficult to implement more if something is missing, even though we have a lot of experience with grid tools like Dingo and so on...",,
11,Degree of Autonomy (DA),"Degree of Autonomy or self sufficiency wished, typically a number between 0 and 1",,,KPI,,,component/constraint exists,,
12,Temporal resolution of simulation,Time step of the simulation. The user should be aware that a higher resolution require more data and can lead to longer simulation times,,,Time,,"OP_IN_01, OP_IN_02",time steps are flexible; it's always a matter of data,,
13,Optimization goal,"The quantities which govern the optimization (CO2, costs, renewable maximization in energy mix, degree of autonomy, multi-objectives)",min,,Simulation,,"OP_IN_04, OP_IN_10","optimization goal can be costs or CO2 emissions; maximization in renewable energy or autonomy seems more to be a constraint; multi-objectives are not possible due to linear programming, but users could input weights",,
14,Maximum investment budget,Upper bound on the investment budget,EUR,,Financial,,OP_IN_07,component/constraint exists,,
15,Current price of CO2 emission certificates,Current price of CO2 emission certificates,EUR,,Financial,,"OP_IN_07, OP_IN_15",data issue?,,
16,Future price estimates for CO2 emission certificates,Timeseries of future price  for CO2 emission certificates (values from the EU-ETS and DE-ETS),EUR,,Financial,,OP_IN_07,data issue?,,The user can load its own timeseries to check their own prediction of CO2 prices
17,Interest rate,A guess of what the  interest rate will be in during the project lifetime. Could be provided as constant or timeseries.,EUR,,Financial,,,function exists,,Estimate the project costs
18,Costs of replacement,Costs of replacement/improvement of the current system components/assets,EUR,,Financial,,,"not sure, if this exists already, but I think if not it's easy to implement; the mobility team has this in their tools as far as I remember",,
19,Grid stability fee,Fee/payment for contribution to grid stability,EUR,,Financial,,,fix cost?,,
20,Spatial resolution,Define the wished spatial resolution (it is wished that it can range from building up to districts),,,GIS,,,spatial resolution is flexible; it's always a matter of data ,,
21,New power plant available space,Available space for new power plants (for PV installation for example),,,GIS,,,upper bounds exist,,"Space on the rooftop is only for solar, fields can be solar and wind, inside existing building diesel/gas/heat exchanger can be installed but no solar or wind"
