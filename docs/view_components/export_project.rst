Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^
..
    a requirement is a binding rule which cannot be described directly by an action
    or which describes redundant actions
    (i.e. "it should not be possible to click on this attribute while the value of this other
    attribute is not defined", or "after changing the value of an already defined attribute,
    one should see a difference in the rendering of the attribute"

1. Requirement 1
2. Requirement 2

:ref:`<view1>-label`
    Description of the link

:ref:`<view2>-label`
    Description of the link

Link with other view-components
