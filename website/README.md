## Framework

[fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is  [faster](https://medium.com/@ahmed.nafies/why-did-we-choose-fast-api-over-flask-and-django-for-our-restful-micro-services-77589534c036) than flask. However I found flask a bit more
 easy at first to use. I think what makes fastapi strong is the concurrency and
  asnychronuous capability. Its definition is similar to flask, making it easy to migrate from
   flask to fastapi if needed.
