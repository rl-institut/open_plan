It means that it is not possible to retrieve as much energy as provided to the battery due to the discharge losses. The efficiency of the 'input power' and 'ouput power' columns should be set equal to the charge and dischage efficiencies respectively, while the 'storage capacity' efficiency should be equal to the storage's efficiency/ability to hold charge over time (`= 1 - self-discharge/decay`), which is usually in the range of 0.95 to 1 for electrical storages."
